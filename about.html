                <p><b><u>Our Mission:</u></b></p>
                    <p>The mission of the Whale Sanctuary Project is to establish a model seaside sanctuary where whales and dolphins can be rehabilitated or can live permanently in an environment that maximizes well-being and autonomy and is as close as possible to their natural habitat.</p>
                <p><b><u>Sanctuary Concept:</u></b></p>             
                <p>The goal of the proposed sanctuary is to offer captive orcas and beluga whales a natural environment that maximizes their opportunities for autonomy, exploration, play, rest, and socializing.</p>
                <p>Considerations as we evaluate any site include the physical and environmental nature of the site itself, and access to fresh water and electric power; whether sanctuary residents might be affected by local wildlife and vice versa; and the concerns of the local community, including commercial and recreational interests.</p>
                <p>Beyond the sanctuary: We are conducting rigorous environmental impact assessments at our locations of interest to ensure that there will be no negative effects on wildlife in and around the sanctuary or in the ocean beyond.</p>

            <h1>Dolphin Project</h1>
            <p><b><u>Our Mission:</u></b></p>
            <p>Dolphin Project is a non-profit charitable organization, dedicated to the welfare and protection of dolphins worldwide. Founded by Richard (Ric) O’Barry on Earth Day, April 22, 1970, the organization aims to educate the public about captivity and, where feasible, retire and/or release captive dolphins. 
            The mission of Dolphin Project is to end dolphin exploitation and slaughter, as dolphins are routinely captured, harassed, slaughtered and sold into captivity around the world – all in the name of profit. Dolphin Project works not only to halt these slaughters, but also to rehabilitate captive dolphins for retirement and/or release, investigate and advocate for economic alternatives to dolphin slaughter, and to put a permanent end to dolphin captivity.</p>
            <p><b><u>"The Cove"</u></b></p>
            <p>Dolphin Project has achieved many important victories for dolphins over the years. We brought the world’s attention to the brutal drive hunts taking place along the coast of Taiji, Japan, as seen in the 2009 Academy Award-winning feature documentary “The Cove,” we successfully negotiated for an end to the dolphin slaughter in the Solomon Islands and we continue to raise awareness that captivity is a cruel and outdated practice.</p>
            <p>Dolphin Project is the longest-running anti-captivity dolphin welfare organization in the world. Our mission today remains the same as it did in 1970: Let’s protect dolphins together!</p>
